# Homework 2  

## Linear Regression  

**Reading in the data and loading it in**   
```{r}
abalone <- read.csv("abalone.csv")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

### Question 1  

```{r}
# Adding age to dataset
age <- abalone$rings + 1.5
abalone2 <- cbind(abalone, age)

# Assessing distribution of age
age_dist <- ggplot(abalone2, aes(age)) +
  geom_histogram()
age_dist
```

The distribution of `age` is right skewed and unimodal. There is a peak in the data at around 11 years old.  

### Question 2  


### Question 3  


### Question 4  


### Question 5  


### Question 6
